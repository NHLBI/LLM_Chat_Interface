# LLM Chat Interface

## Overview

LLM Chat Interface is a chat front-end interface designed to provide staff with a secured, chat-like experience for their day-to-day work, through calls to Microsoft Azure's OpenAI API. This application mimics public tooling like ChatGPT and Google Bard, leveraging the Azure OpenAI API for basic chat functionalities and file uploads. 

## Features

- Basic chat interface similar to popular AI chat tools.
- File upload capability for document analysis. Accepted file formats include .pdf,.docx,.pptx,.txt,.md,.json, and .xml.
- Uses Azure OpenAI API for generating responses.

## Building and Launching

To build and host the LLM Chat Interface application:

1. Clone the repository to your local or server environment.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (as specified in the Code Dependencies section below).
3. Copy the `example_chat_config.ini` to your PHP include location. Note that we use the include path, '/etc/apps/chat_config.ini'.
4. Configure the application settings in the `chat_config.ini` file.
5. Utilize the `chat_db.sql` to set up the database schema.
6. Follow deployment instructions to get the web server running (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

## Code Dependencies

The application relies on the following code dependencies:

- PHP: Your web server should have PHP installed and configured (we use PHP 8.0.30).

- MariaDB or MySQL: You need a database to store chat-related data (we use Server version: 10.5.22-MariaDB MariaDB Server).

- Python: The application uses Python for text extraction from various file formats (we use Python 3.9.18).

- Libraries for Python:
  - `docx` (for parsing .docx files)
  - `pdfminer` (for parsing .pdf files)
  - `python-pptx` (for parsing .pptx files)

- JavaScript Libraries: The application uses JavaScript libraries that are loaded from external sources:
  - Bootstrap
  - Highlight.js

## Azure API Configuration

For the Azure OpenAI API, you will need:

- An API key from Azure.
- The deployment name and API version you intend to use.
- The appropriate URL endpoint for API calls.
- Token and context limits as per your Azure plan.

## LDAP / Authentication Information

The application uses OpenID for authentication. You will need to configure:

- `authorization_url_base`, `clientId`, `client_secret`, and `callback` for OpenID.
- LDAP configurations for user authentication against your directory service.

## Database Information

The MariaDB schema for this chat interface is very simple, just two tables: `chat` and `exchange`. Note, the summary field is not in use at the moment. Additionally, the data is never deleted, we simply flag as deleted and hide in the interface. 

-- Table structure for table `chat`
--

CREATE TABLE `chat` (
  `id` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  `user` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `title` varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL,
  `summary` text DEFAULT NULL,
  `deployment` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL,
  `document_name` varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL,
  `document_text` longtext DEFAULT NULL,
  `deleted` tinyint(4) DEFAULT 0,
  `timestamp` timestamp NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;

--
-- Table structure for table `exchange`
--

CREATE TABLE `exchange` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `chat_id` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  `user` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `prompt` text DEFAULT NULL,
  `reply` text DEFAULT NULL,
  `deployment` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL,
  `deleted` tinyint(4) DEFAULT 0,
  `timestamp` timestamp NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `fk_exchange_chat` (`chat_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `fk_exchange_chat` FOREIGN KEY (`chat_id`) REFERENCES `chat` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;p

## Configuration Changes

Before launching the application, you need to make the following changes to the configuration files:

- Fill out the Azure API section with your specific API keys and deployment information.
- Update the OpenID and LDAP sections with your institution's authentication details.
- Customize the `[app]` section with your application's title, logo, and disclosure information.
- Ensure that the `[database]` section has the correct credentials for your database.

Note that the provided `example_chat_config.ini` serves as a template and must be filled with your specific details.
