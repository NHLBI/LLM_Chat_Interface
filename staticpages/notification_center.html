  <h3>What's New</h3>
<strong>PII Now Approved for use in NHLBI Chat</strong>
<p>PII (excluding SSN/EIN/TIN) may be entered into NHLBI Chat. Please ensure that any PII use case is absolutely necessary, and to the best of your knowledge, permission to use this PII has been obtained separately from the impacted person(s). When possible, de-identify and anonymize data.</p>
<strong>Document Generation Roll Back</strong>
<p>We disabled the ability to create documents in NHLBI Chat. This feature was negatively impacting application performance.</p>
<strong>Automatic Chat Deletion</strong>
<p>Starting Tuesday September 2, NHLBI Chat will automatically delete any chat inactive for 90 days. Deleted chats will be stored for an additional 90 days, after which they will be permanently deleted. This change is to align with record retention schedules for temporary and transitory records. You can always print your chats (using the "Print" button in the application) if you need to maintain a record of your chat. </p>
