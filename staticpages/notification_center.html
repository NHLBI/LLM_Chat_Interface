  <h3>What's New</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h2>Improved Document Upload</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Large documents now upload using RAG. This allows you to upload large documents that exceed model size context windows. When using RAG, NHLBI Chat will identify the documents that it uses to retrieve answers.</li>
          <li>Document upload and document parsing now happen asynchronously. After you upload a document, you will be quickly returned to the main site and see a progress bar estimating processing time.</li>
          <li>Uploaded documents still appear in the left panel under your conversation and will show a green check mark when processed.</li>
          <li>Documents used in a prompt will display an icon for their type. Click the icon to preview the text of that document.</li>
          <li>You can now enable and disable documents within a conversation. Click the green check to disable (shows as a gray X) and click again to re-enable the document. Prompts ignore disabled documents. This feature lets you avoid having to delete and re-upload documents.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Streaming Replies</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Chat replies will now stream automatically, allowing you to see answers as they generate instead of waiting for the full reply.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Previous Prompt Navigation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Press <b>Option</b> + <b>Up Arrow</b> to quickly cycle through your previous prompts within a conversation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Audio Playback</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All chat replies now feature a “Play Audio” button, allowing you to listen to responses.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
