Grant 5R01HL148207-04 Specific Aims

Aim 1: Determine the molecular basis for miR-615-5p control of AKT/eNOS signaling in endothelial cells following ischemic injury.
Aim 2: Evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-615-5p inhibition to restore perfusion and angiogenesis in preclinical models of cardiovascular disease.
Aim 3: Map safety, dose, and delivery parameters for clinical translation using primary human endothelial cultures and advanced imaging readouts.

These aims summarize the validation document used to confirm automated ingestion for the NHLBI chat platform.
